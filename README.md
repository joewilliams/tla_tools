tla_tools
=========

Put these scripts on your PATH and they should help you run the [TLA+ Tools](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/tools.html)

Note that you may need to modify `lib/common` with the appropriate paths.

Also, from what I can tell all of these tools expect to be run in the same directory as the input files.

Example:

``````
joe@hostname ~/src/some/path $ tlc2 blah.tla

``````
